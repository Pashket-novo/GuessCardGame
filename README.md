# GuessCardGame

Program allow a person to play a Guess a C♠rd Game. 
The aim of the Guess a C♠rd Game is for a player to correctly guess a playing card drawn randomly by the computer. 
The player has a set number of attempts to guess the card. However, they are allocated points at the start of the game and are penalised for each incorrect attempt.
The game ends when a correct guess is entered, the points are zero or less, or the player has run out of guesses.
The points remaining at the end of the game are counted as the score for the game. 
The player may play a series of games, with cumulative game results displayed after the final game when the player decides to stop playing.
The deck of cards from which the cards are drawn is a standard fifty-two card deck.
It has four suits: Hearts♥, Diamonds♦, Clubs♣ and Spades♠.
Each suit has thirteen cards: an Ace, which is regarded as number 1 for this game; cards numbered 2 to 10 inclusive.
Each suit also three “face cards”: a Jack, number 11 for this game; a Queen, number 12 for this game; and a King, number 13 for this game.
